/*  4 Laws of Red Black Tree

1. All nodes are colored, Red or Black
2. The root is always Black (no impact if root turn red make it black)
3. A red node cannot have a red child 
(if we have red -> red ; it needs to rotation || rebalnce)

4. all path from root to all children must pass through the 
same number of black nodes.

ex. if we go through nodes and count the nodes. 
    - purpose of the law to recognizae when rotation is nesscerry.

    (whenever we insertion(insert ) new node we insert as red)
