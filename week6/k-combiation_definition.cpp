5 different color ball choose 3 color and see how many 
number a way. (3. combination from set of 5.)

notate = n choose 3.

Theorem let n and k be two non negative integers, 
such that k < n. the number of k - combination of a set with element equals.
n/k = (n! /k!(n-k)!)

5! = Factorial 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
5/3 = 5! /3! * 2! = 10
